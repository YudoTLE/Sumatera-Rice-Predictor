# Sumatera Rice Predictor
Machine learning model that predicts rice production per harvest area (ton/ha) in Sumatra based on climate data, including rainfall, humidity, and temperature.

## Dataset and Units of Measurement
The dataset used for this project consists of historical rice production data (from 1993 to 2020) for 8 provinces in Sumatra: Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD), Sumatera Utara, Riau, Jambi, Sumatera Selatan, Bengkulu, and Lampung. It includes data on annual rice production and the corresponding harvest area (land area). Additionally, climate data on rainfall, humidity, and average temperature is obtained from BMKG (Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency).

### Unit of Measurement:
- **Rainfall**: Millimeters (mm) per month
- **Humidity**: Percentage (%)
- **Temperature**: Degrees Celsius (Â°C)
- **Production per Harvest Area**: Tons per hectare (ton/ha)
